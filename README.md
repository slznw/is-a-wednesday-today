# is-a-wednesday-today
I was inspired by this (https://github.com/caseif/wednesday.exe) program and decided to provide you with additional functionality for it! Now it can check it is Wednesday or not, and depending on this, show you a meme with moaning toads.

## Usage:
`python pithon.py` (or u can rename this code)

## Requiremments
+ python 3
+ windows (i tested on win11)
